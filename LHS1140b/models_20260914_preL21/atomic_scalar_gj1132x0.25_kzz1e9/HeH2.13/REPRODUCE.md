# How this model was reached

Written by `models/write_reproduce.py`, called by the runner at the end of the run it describes.

## The case

`atomic_scalar_gj1132x0.25_kzz1e9/HeH2.13`

- chemistry: H, He, He(2^3S) and electrons; no molecular network (`atomic`)
- lower boundary: prescribed scalar base, T = 226 K, R_0 = 0.157692 R_J, p = 1 microbar, metal-free (`scalar`)
- spectrum: `gj1132x0.25`
- mixing: binary H/He element diffusion with He_Kzz = 1e9 cm^2/s (`kzz1e9`)

The `input.inp` in this directory is the file the solution was started from; the runner puts it back after the post-processing pass, which needs three of its keys changed.

## The seed

`models/pick_seed.py` chose, out of the states that carry this case's physics:

```
/nfs/mocafe/kiseon/RT_Codes/ExoAtmosphere/EXHALE_v1.00/LHS1140b/models/atomic_scalar_gj1132_kzz1e9/HeH2.13/output  tier3:models/atomic_scalar_gj1132_kzz1e9  HeH=2.13  target=2.13  dlog10=0.0000  candidates=91  (a certified case at another XUV normalization); then a continuation from the first solve's written state at dtau0=1.0e8 (its log run_dtau0_first.log)
```

The fields are the state directory, the tier it was taken from (`tier1` a certified case of the same group, `tier2` a certified case of another group with the same physics, `tier3` the same at another XUV normalization, `tier4` and `tier5` the archive) with the group or the code generation it belongs to, the seed reservoir He/H, this case's, the distance |log10 He/H_seed - log10 He/H_case| the choice minimizes, and how many states of that tier carried the physics at all.

It was interpolated onto the cell centers of the current code by

```
python3 /nfs/mocafe/kiseon/RT_Codes/ExoAtmosphere/EXHALE_v1.00/src/utils/map_state_to_grid.py \
    /nfs/mocafe/kiseon/RT_Codes/ExoAtmosphere/EXHALE_v1.00/LHS1140b/models/atomic_scalar_gj1132_kzz1e9/HeH2.13/output \

## What came out

The outer passes of the partitioned stationary route, as `run.log` records them:

## Reproducing it

Run the commands above, in this directory, in the order they are given; each pass reads what the one before it wrote, so the order is the content and not a convenience.

The OpenMP parallelization of the cell ionization sweep is bitwise identical to the serial result (`README.md`, feature list) and the BLAS thread pool is pinned to one thread by the run itself, so `OMP_NUM_THREADS` is expected to change the wall clock and not the answer; the regression harness nonetheless fixes `OMP_NUM_THREADS=1` because that is the only setting under which it compares outputs bitwise. This run used `OMP_NUM_THREADS=8`. A different binary -- another compiler, another BLAS -- reproduces the physics and not the last digits.

The seed is another solved state, not a fresh one: a certified case of `models/` where one of the right physics exists, otherwise an archived state out of `archive_20260830/`, which is never rewritten. Either way it is interpolated onto the current grid. The solve does not depend on which seed of the right physics is used -- three seeds four decades apart in the base velocity land on the same fixed point to 1e-8 (`docs/lhs1140b_stationary_L5c_20260913.md`, T9b) -- so a rerun whose `pick_seed.py` chooses differently, because another case has been certified since, is still the same solution.
