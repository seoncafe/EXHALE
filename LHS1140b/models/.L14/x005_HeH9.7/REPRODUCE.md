# How this model was reached

Written by `models/write_reproduce.py`, called by the runner at the end of the run it describes.

## The case

`.L14/x005_HeH9.7`


The `input.inp` in this directory is the file the solution was started from; the runner puts it back after the post-processing pass, which needs three of its keys changed.

## The seed

`models/pick_seed.py` chose, out of the states that carry this case's physics:

```
/nfs/mocafe/kiseon/RT_Codes/ExoAtmosphere/EXHALE_v1.00/LHS1140b/models/atomic_scalar_gj1132x0.10_kzz1e9/HeH9.7/output (given)
```

The fields are the state directory, the tier it was taken from (`tier1` a certified case of the same group, `tier2` a certified case of another group with the same physics, `tier3` the same at another XUV normalization, `tier4` and `tier5` the archive) with the group or the code generation it belongs to, the seed reservoir He/H, this case's, the distance |log10 He/H_seed - log10 He/H_case| the choice minimizes, and how many states of that tier carried the physics at all.

The grid the seed is written on is named by `/nfs/mocafe/kiseon/RT_Codes/ExoAtmosphere/EXHALE_v1.00/LHS1140b/models/current_grid_Hydro_ioniz.txt`.

It was interpolated onto the cell centers of the current code by

```
python3 /nfs/mocafe/kiseon/RT_Codes/ExoAtmosphere/EXHALE_v1.00/src/utils/map_state_to_grid.py \
    /nfs/mocafe/kiseon/RT_Codes/ExoAtmosphere/EXHALE_v1.00/LHS1140b/models/atomic_scalar_gj1132x0.10_kzz1e9/HeH9.7/output \
    /nfs/mocafe/kiseon/RT_Codes/ExoAtmosphere/EXHALE_v1.00/LHS1140b/models/current_grid_Hydro_ioniz.txt output --ic 
```

## The commands

```bash
# the seed, interpolated onto the current cell centers

```

## What came out

The outer passes of the marching plus the JFNK hand-off, as `run.log` records them:

| pass | hydro info | mass | momentum | energy | worst gated species row | at cell | s |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 2 | 3.77E-08 | 1.96E-12 | 5.68E-01 | 3.90E-03 of 1.0E-05 (elemental transport He/H partition) | 376 | 869.71 |
| 2 | 2 | 3.80E-08 | 1.96E-12 | 5.82E-01 | 1.54E-03 of 1.0E-05 (elemental transport He/H partition) | 382 | 627.20 |
| 3 | 2 | 3.62E-08 | 1.96E-12 | 5.86E-01 | 6.29E-04 of 1.0E-05 (elemental transport He/H partition) | 388 | 578.65 |

- solver verdict: **info = 2** (last `||R||` = 5.857E-01), by the marching plus the JFNK hand-off
- certification of the state written: **NOT CERTIFIED**
  - hydrodynamic energy row: row measure  5.857E-01 above  1.0E-06 at cell 251
  - elemental transport He/H partition: gated row measure  6.287E-04 above  1.0E-05 at cell 388 (a wind cell)
- wall clock **42m31s** at `OMP_NUM_THREADS=8`, 2026-09-14 17:31:55 to 2026-09-14 18:14:26

## Reproducing it

Run the commands above, in this directory, in the order they are given; each pass reads what the one before it wrote, so the order is the content and not a convenience.

The OpenMP parallelization of the cell ionization sweep is bitwise identical to the serial result (`README.md`, feature list) and the BLAS thread pool is pinned to one thread by the run itself, so `OMP_NUM_THREADS` is expected to change the wall clock and not the answer; the regression harness nonetheless fixes `OMP_NUM_THREADS=1` because that is the only setting under which it compares outputs bitwise. This run used `OMP_NUM_THREADS=8`. A different binary -- another compiler, another BLAS -- reproduces the physics and not the last digits.

The seed is another solved state, not a fresh one: a certified case of `models/` where one of the right physics exists, otherwise an archived state out of `archive_20260830/`, which is never rewritten. Either way it is interpolated onto the current grid. The solve does not depend on which seed of the right physics is used -- three seeds four decades apart in the base velocity land on the same fixed point to 1e-8 (`docs/lhs1140b_stationary_L5c_20260913.md`, T9b) -- so a rerun whose `pick_seed.py` chooses differently, because another case has been certified since, is still the same solution.
